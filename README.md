## How to get high

### Fonts

We use Google fonts for our default font support module, which each font file is resolved from google/fonts repository as a submodule. To get all the fonts, you need to run the following command after cloning the repository.

```baas
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> ## WARNING!
>
> Don't let the playful names fool you. This isn't your garden-variety 3D Text Motion Graphics Generator. Some users have likened its allure to more... illicit substances. With its intoxicating blend of high-grade code, our digital greenhouse grows not plants, but mind-bending visuals that may prove addictive. But don't worry, everything here is perfectly legal, just incredibly potent. So proceed with caution, and remember to render responsibly.
