My fonts are free for noncommercial use and are donationware for commercial purposes. If you'd like to use a font of mine for commercial purposes, I ask that you make a donation of $20.00 USD per user/seat using the PayPal Donate button below.
PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!
In the event the Donate button above does not work properly, you can always donate directly through your PayPal account to the e-mail address DMZadorozny@aol.com
Please e-mail me to let me know so that I can reply back with my consent to use the font commercially. For specific terms of such consent please see the details below. Please note that charitable, nonprofit, academic and educational uses are noncommercial to me regardless of whether or not the specific project may generate money.

Terms of Use:
After making your donation you have the nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual and worldwide right to use the font for unlimited commercial purposes and in any medium (print, online, commercial, merchandise, logos, etc.) The only prohibition is on selling the font as a font (as opposed to a game application that has the font within it). The Iconian Fonts website and fonts are the copyrighted creations of Dan Zadorozny. All fonts and files are offered "as is" and there are no guarantees that a font will work well on a particular machine or with a particular software product. Since the fonts are freely available for immediate download, you have the ability to test the fonts' quality and compatibility with your machine and software prior to making any donation.
