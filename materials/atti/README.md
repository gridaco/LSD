## A Note from Original Author

```txt
Hey thanks for downloading.

Use this shader on anything you like commercial or otherwise
Please do not sell this shader. You can give it away though!
It is 100% free to use and I would like it to remain that way.

I built this shader by combining ideas from a few tutorials and spent the last few
months optimizing it. Currently this shader only works in cycles but I am looking in
to ways of porting it to eevee.

If you have any ideas for future optimization/features or have any questions feel
free to DM me on twitter @atti3D
